<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a passionate Product Design Manager with a deep background in UX, I've always been driven by the challenge of creating seamless, user-friendly experiences that resonate with people. 
  My journey into design began after studying biomedical sciences and working in pharmaceutical sales, where I discovered a love for solving complex problems creatively. 
  Over the years, I've honed my skills leading a team of talented designers, focusing on both internal and client-facing applications, with a particular emphasis on automating and streamlining user experiences in the financial sector. 
  I'm currently diving into coding to further refine my problem-solving framework and bring my creative visions to life.</p>

<p>Beyond my professional life, I'm the proud owner of a 7-month-old French Bulldog and have been in a loving relationship with my girlfriend for seven years. 
  Our little family means the world to me, and we're on a journey toward financial health, working to create a secure future together. 
  I'm also passionate about drawing, dancing, and performing, which allow me to connect with people and express myself in unique ways.</p>

<p>I'm continually seeking ways to grow and learn, whether it's through expanding my technical skills or building meaningful connections. 
  My vision is to combine creativity, technical expertise, and leadership to not only achieve personal and professional success but also to support my family, mentor others, and foster a life of independence and authenticity.</p>
